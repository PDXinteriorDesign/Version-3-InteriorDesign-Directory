      "description": "​Here at the studio of SE DESIGN, we focus on designing homes people love being in and escaping to, homes that embrace a sense of our client's history, lifestyle and sense of adventure. Homes that are comfortably sophisticated, rich and relaxed. We create a living experience that's as beautiful as it is functional. \n\nWe take a friendly but highly organized approach to each client’s project.  Great communication and project management keep our clients in the know each step of the way, without making them feel overwhelmed.  Our client roster is comprised predominately of return business and client referrals, which is a strong testament to both our creative talent and work ethic.  Most clients return for their next projects: new residences, vacation homes or just design refreshes.  From selecting finishes and flooring to designing furniture to managing trades; for residential or commercial projects. While rooted in Oregon, we go anywhere we are needed. Whatever and wherever your design needs may be, our ultimate goal is to provide exceptional service to each client and deliver them their dream home.  We truly love what we do and want all clients to feel nothing less than thrilled with their experience.​",
